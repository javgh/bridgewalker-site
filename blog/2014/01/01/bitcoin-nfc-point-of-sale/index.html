  <h1>Using Bitcoin, NFC and Bluetooth to make a mobile euro payment in 15 seconds</h1>
  <span class="post-date">01 Jan 2014</span>
  <p>Bridgewalker has always been about exploring the idea of using "Bitcoin, the
network" solely as a payment mechanism, but avoiding "Bitcoin, the currency" and
its volatility by exchanging in and out of local currencies before and after the
payment takes place. Using Bitcoin in this way, it then becomes a technical
solution similiar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Clearing_House">ACH network</a>
or credit card networks, in that it provides a payment network which allows the
electronic transfer of funds denominated in fiat (e.g. euro or dollar). But a
payment network which has no barrier of entry, as anyone can plug in, as long
as they speak the Bitcoin protocol. This concept has also been described as
Bitcoin being "money over IP" or an <a href="http://onbitcoin.com/2013/07/30/finding-business-model-opportunities-in-bitcoin-inside-bitcoins-nyc/">"IP address for
money"</a>.</p>

<h3>Point of sale demo</h3>

<p>The following video is a technology demo of how Bitcoin might be used in this
manner in a point of sale setting, where a customer wants to pay contactless
with his smartphone. To set the stage: In this example the merchant is using a
laptop to initiate the process. She enters the price of the product - let's say
2 euros - and the software uses the current Bitcoin exchange rate to calculate a
Bitcoin amount, which is then shown to the customer on an external screen
together with payment instructions. The customer holds his phone close to the
NFC pad and receives the payment details. In this case he uses the Bridgewalker
app, where he maintains a euro balance, which can be converted to bitcoins for
the purpose of transfer at a moment's notice. The app picks up the payment
request and - after final confirmation by the user - sends out a Bitcoin
transaction. To increase speed and especially reliability a copy of the Bitcoin
transaction is also sent back to the merchant via Bluetooth. The payment is now
complete (caveat: the risk of double spending - see discussion below). In the
video the merchant simply receives the bitcoins via Bitcoin-Qt. But one could
imagine to plug in a merchant solution like BitPay or Coinbase here, which would
then convert back to euros to complete the cycle. Here is the video:</p>

<h3>Technical details</h3>

<p>First off: If you do not care about all the back and forth with traditional
currencies, then this solution can of course also be used in a Bitcoin-only
manner. It is based on work that Andreas Schildbach already did for the Android
Bitcoin wallet (great stuff - thanks!) and is fully compatible with that. So the
Schildbach wallet will pick up the NFC payment request and also the transaction
transfer over Bluetooth is compatible. The code for the point of sale terminal
is open source and you can find it
<a href="https://github.com/javgh/greenaddress-pos-tools">over on GitHub</a>. The
repository also has some notes about the recommended NFC hardware.</p>

<h3>Currency conversions and fees</h3>

<p>All this currency conversion back and forth is terrible convoluted and must be
pretty expensive, you might be thinking at this point. Why not just transfer
euros directly, if that is the goal? To expand on what I wrote in the
introduction: The problem with transferring euros electronically is the fact,
that there is no such thing as a digital euro. You can only have digital IOUs
for euros - that is promises from someone, that they will pay you a euro later -
and you can then transfer those digital IOUs. That means you will always have to
be very careful about whose IOUs you accept, so that you can be sure that you
are getting paid in the end.</p>

<p>Bitcoin, on the other hand, stands for itself. It is a digital commodity that
commands a market price and it therefore does not matter from whom you are
receiving those bitcoins. It is the digital equivalent of "cash is king".
Building a payment network with Bitcoin at the core allows for a much more open
approach where everyone is free to connect to and become a part of that network.</p>

<p>To make it cost-competitive, the "on- and off-ramps" to the Bitcoin network, the
exchanges, need to be efficient. That means low fees on one hand, and also tight
spreads - the difference between the highest buy offer and the lowest sell offer
- on the other hand. In the case of Bridgewalker, for example, this currently
amounts to a fee of around 1.5 % for a "round trip". So sending out 100 EUR in
the form of bitcoins and then depositing them again, will typically leave you
with 98.50 EUR (although transfers between Bridgewalker users are internal and
free, by the way). At the moment Bridgewalker uses Mt.Gox as its exchange
platform. Then you have to factor in the cost for the user to get bitcoins in
the first place, to fund his Bridgewalker account, and that might be another
percent or two. On the merchant side very competitive pricing options are
available from both BitPay and Coinbase. All in all, I think you can stay under
3 % even today, to pick a number that is typical for credit card fees, and there
is quite a bit of room to push this down further as Bitcoin exchanges mature.</p>

<p>Lastly I want to point out, that Bridgewalker is just a technical prototype and
I therefore opted to only allow funding of accounts via Bitcoin. This creates
additional points of currency exchange, but frees me from interfacing with the
traditional banking system and instead allows me to focus on experimenting with
the user interface. An institution that would undertake a direct integration
with, for example, the ACH network should be able to reduce fees even more.</p>

<p>In fact, a highly upvoted <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1stdek/with_recent_news_that_coinbase_acquired_25m_in/">feature
request</a>
for Coinbase to implement a "buy-as-you-spend" feature would be essentially just
that. It would allow a user to spend bitcoins via the Coinbase app and have it
replenished by pulling fiat from their bank account. This is essentially just a
mechanism to spend fiat from their bank account via Bitcoin, which brings us
back to the idea of using Bitcoin solely as a payment mechanism.</p>

<h3>Double spending</h3>

<p>Discussing the topic of double spend risk management really requires a whole
blog post or more like a series of them in itself, and this post is already
getting too long. But just a few comments here: The common wisdom so far has
been, that for small in person payments the risk of accepting zero-confirmation
transactions is minimal.  I agree that this is probably true. Although it is
only true, if the merchant receives the transaction via the Bitcoin network and
therefore has some indication that it has been broadcasted widely.</p>

<p>In this setting the merchant receives the transaction directly from the
customer, which makes it much easier for the customer to trick the merchant, by
sending a conflicting transaction simultaneously to the rest of the Bitcoin
network. So this is still one of the pieces missing from this solution, before
it is ready for real world usage. The merchant should wait a few extra seconds
(unfortunately adding extra delay) and then check with a number of
highly connected Bitcoin nodes whether there are any known double spends
(feature request for Blockchain.info: return the double spend info that you are
collecting already via your JSON api. It would be great if the data returned for
a transaction would have an extra field called "known_double_spends" or
"known_conflicts" which would be simply "true" or "false" or maybe a list of
conflicting transaction ids). This would, I believe, be a reasonably secure
heuristic for small amounts.</p>

<p>In general though, receiving the transaction directly from the customer will be
the only solution going forward. Relying on a gossip-style peer-to-peer network,
as Bitcoin is, for timely delivery of transactions will simply fail too often
(for some anecdotal evidence of this, see for example <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ly1h3/bitcoin_is_too_slow_for_in_person_transactions/">this
thread</a>).</p>

<p>As an aside: The demo above employs <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Green_address">green
addresses</a>. Bridgewalker transactions
can be recognized by their use of coins from 1MAxx46Dp3tFw933PxPwEYYGCpxYda2pyH
which is why the backend displays "Verified by Bridgewalker" after receiving the
transaction. So in this case the merchant knows where to complain, if anything
murky should happen with the transaction afterwards.</p>

<p>Green addresses are a hack - I said as much, when I proposed them back in 2011 -
and now that we have <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0070">BIP 70</a>, the payment
protocol proposal, this would probably be a better outlet to integrate a similar
mechanism.</p>

<h3>Future work</h3>

<p>All of this should probably be ported to use the payment protocol, which should
allow to add some other niceties as well, like displaying some meta information
about the payment directly on the client side (what is this for? who is
requesting it? have they signed the request?). Then of course the mentioned
double spend detection heuristic needs to be added. It would also be helpful to
replace the use of Bitcoin-Qt with a more lightweight client, to be able to run
the point of sale terminal on something like a Raspberry Pi.</p>
