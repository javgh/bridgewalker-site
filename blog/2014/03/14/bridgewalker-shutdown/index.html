  <h1>Mt.Gox fallout&#58; Bridgewalker is shutting down</h1>
  <span class="post-date">14 Mar 2014</span>
  <p>It is with regret that I have to announce, that Bridgewalker is shutting down.
Since it was using Mt.Gox as the backend exchange, it was directly affected by
Mt.Gox imploding. But there were also a few other factors which played into this
decision, which I detail below. Thanks to everyone who supported this project!</p>

<p>All user funds will be returned in full. An update should be available shortly
through Google Play which will allow you to submit a Bitcoin address, where you
would like to have your funds sent. I will use
<a href="https://bitcoinaverage.com/markets.htm#EUR">BitcoinAverage</a> to determine the
exchange rate. Please allow a few days for your request to be processed. I will
be returning user funds for at least the next 6 months, but would ask you to put
in your request soon. Feel free to email me if you have any questions.</p>

<p>"Why did you still use Mt.Gox? You should have seen that coming long ago!" True,
and I did to some extend, which is why my losses are manageable. The main reason
I never did the switch - and I contemplated it several times - was, that for all
its shortcomings, Mt.Gox still was for a long time the only big exchange with a
streaming data feed. And I considered it an important feature to keep track of
the market very closely, to be able to safely provide competitive currency
conversion services - a major cornerstone of the Bridgewalker architecture. So
switching to a different exchange would have required quite a bit of extra work
and a worse service level as a result. Not the most attractive value
proposition, so I decided to instead work on new features and hope that Mt.Gox
would get their act together. That optimism was unfortunately misplaced, but I
am prepared to deal with the consequences. The losses that did occur I will
replace out of my personal funds.</p>

<p>But the Mt.Gox debacle is not the only reason for the shutdown. So far, I
have not managed to gain the traction with Bridgewalker that I was hoping for.
There are probably many reasons for that, among them certainly, that it is a
tough sell to get people to entrust their funds with an unproven startup. And
for good reasons! I was always looking for ways to get rid of the requirement of
holding user funds, but have so far not found a practical and cost-competitive
alternative.</p>

<p>I still believe, that a service like Bridgewalker - providing a way of using
Bitcoin only as a payment mechanism, without holding Bitcoin yourself - is
something that has a target audience. As we go forward, we will hopefully be
able to deploy interesting Bitcoin-based solutions. Solutions like tap-to-pay,
metered billing (e.g. WiFi paid by the kb using micropayment channels) and making
smallish payments right in the browser, to name just three things that I find
very interesting. I am convinced that there will be a group of users, that will
want to use these services, but would rather maintain their account in their
trusted fiat currency of choice.</p>

<p>And there are good reasons for wanting to keep your funds in fiat:</p>

<ul>
<li>The often cited volatility of Bitcoin. It is true and will likely remain true
for some time to come.</li>
<li>Familiarity with your local currency. You have a feeling for what things cost
and a sense of stability, simply because everything around you is priced in
that same currency. Your currency might fluctuate on the world markets, but
your coffee at Starbucks still costs the same as yesterday - at least on most
days.</li>
<li>Easier accounting. This one is especially important for the merchant side.
Conducting business relies a lot on proper accounting and even if you are the
biggest Bitcoin fan, it might not be worth the trouble, to have to track a
foreign currency and deal with things like gains and losses caused by exchange
rate changes. Simply pretending that the customer paid you in your local
currency and just used Bitcoin as a technical solution to do so, can simplify
your bookkeeping and make it easier to get started accepting Bitcoins.
(Bridgewalker would have eventually attempted to eat BitPay's lunch. ;-P )</li>
<li>Separating the use of Bitcoin as an investment and the use of Bitcoin as a
payment mechanism. Keep your bitcoins in cold storage and keep some fiat in
your Bridgewalker account to spend on Bitcoin services, without affecting your
Bitcoin holdings. The often requested "buy-as-you-spend" feature of Coinbase
follows from the same motivation.</li>
</ul>


<p>In some ways, it might be, that Bridgewalker was simply too early and
Bitcoin-based solutions will need to mature more, before there is a real demand
for this type of service. I might try again at a later time. If I do, it will be
without an exchange in the background though. It's simply too big of a failure
point and also creates all sorts of legal challenges. Maybe projects like
<a href="https://www.counterparty.co/">Counterparty</a> or
<a href="https://www.ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> will be ready by that time, to provide
crypto-equivalents of USD and EUR, that track their real-world counter party
through some kind of gambling/financial derivatives.</p>

<p>Then the Bridgewalker client could be completely server-less and just use one or
several blockchains to provide the same functionality. I would imagine, that the
client would maintain a small amount of bitcoins as a buffer, to be able to
quickly make transactions. But then move bitcoins from and to the buffer into
cryptoUSD or cryptoEUR to keep the purchasing power pegged to those fiat
currencies. The question is, whether this can be made cost-competitive, which
depends on the amount of market spread, slippage, tracking errors and other
sources of friction.</p>

<p>By the way, Bridgewalker is
<a href="/blog/2014/01/07/bridgewalker-open-source/">open source</a>,
so if you feel like tackling any of this and want to reuse parts of
Bridgewalker, feel free to do so!</p>

<p>For the moment, I will be focusing on pure Bitcoin wallets again at
<a href="https://www.hivewallet.com/">Hive</a>. Our Android wallet will be arriving shortly
- keep an eye out for it! And who knows, maybe at some point Bridgewalker will
be rising from its ashes. ;-) Thanks again for all your support!</p>
